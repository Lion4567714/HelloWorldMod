# Hello World Mod
 
This is my first attempt at Minecraft modding. My intention is to make something fun that me and my friends can play with and enjoy.

## What the Mod Does

- Adds 2 new test items
- New items displayed in a separate tab of the creative menu

## How to Install the Mod

Please skip ahead in this section to your level of installation.
**NOTE**: This section runs under the assumption you have Minecraft installed already.

1. Installing Minecraft 1.18.2
   1. Open your copy of the Minecraft Launcher.
   2. If your Minecraft version number (pictured on the bottom left of the window) is not '1.18.2', please proceed with this step. Otherwise continue to Step 2.
   3. Navigate to the 'Installations' tab.
   4. Select 'New Installation'.
   5. Select your desired installation picture and name (these options are purely cosmetic). For the version, select 'release 1.18.2', and create your new installation.
   6. Select 'Play' and let Minecraft boot up to the Main Menu. Then you may close Minecraft (this step is to allow Minecraft to make the necessary files for mod installation).
2. Installing Forge 1.18.2
   1. Navigate to the [Forge website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
   2. Find the Minecraft 1.18.2 version of Forge and click the download for the installer. You may select either the Latest or Recommended version (choose the recommended version if available).
   3. After waiting 5 seconds for the advertisment window to finish, click 'Skip'. **NOTE**: Do **NOT** click anything else on this window.
   4. After the download finishes, run the .jar file you downloaded. Ensure 'Install Client' is selected and press 'OK'.
   5. Once done, close the Forge installer and run Minecraft again. The current installation should now be your version of Forge. Select 'Play' and get to the Main Menu. Minecraft will ask you if you are sure about running Minecraft with Forge, check the box and continue.
3. Installing My Mod
   1. The Main Menu of Minecraft (with Forge) should have a 'Mods' button. Select this, then 'Open Mods Folder'.
   2. Navigate to the [Builds](Builds) folder in this repository.
   3. Select the desired version.
   4. Press 'Download'.
   5. Move the downloaded file from your downloads folder to the opened Minecraft mods folder.
   6. Close and reopen Minecraft (this is a necessary step anytime the mods folder is changed. I recommend adding the 'mods' folder that Minecraft opens to your Quick Access menu for easier access next time).
